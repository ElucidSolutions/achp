View Lightbox Module
====================

The View Lightbox module defines an image field formatter named
Lightbox Image Formatter that extends the default field formatter
provided by the core Image module. This formatter takes the HTML
output generated by the default image field formatter and adds the
data attributes and classes needed by the Lightbox2 JS library. Users
can view image fields that use this formatter within a lightbox
mode by clicking on them.

To enable this formatter, simply select Views UI > Fields > AN
IMAGE FIELD > Configure Field > Formatter = Lightbox Image.


Note:

* Images must have an alt attribute to be included within a Lightbox group.
