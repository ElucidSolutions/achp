Contact Redirect
================

By default, users are submitted back to the home page when they
submit a message using the contact forms provided by the Contact
module without any feedback or confirmation or receipt.

This module allows site administrators to redirect users to another
page after they send a message using a contact form.

To use this module simply open the module configuration settings
and enter the URL that you want to redirect users to.
