Subscribe Module Readme
=======================

The Subscribe module defines two form blocks, subscribe and
unsubscribe. These blocks contain a configurable newsletter
subscription form. You can configure their target URLs using their
block configuration forms.

This block was originally created to allow users to subscribe to ACHP
newsletters. ACHP uses http://www.createsend.ie/ to publish email
newsletters. As long as ACHP uses this service, subscription requests
should be sent to http://achp.createsend.com/t/1/s/stuk/. Unsubscribe
requests should be sent to http://achp.createsend.com/t/1/u/stuk/.
